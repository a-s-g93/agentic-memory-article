# Agent Memory Graph Data Models

This repository contains graph-based data models for implementing different types of agent memory systems. These models are designed to represent and manage various aspects of agent memory in a structured, graph-based format.

## Overview

Agent memory is a crucial component in AI systems, enabling agents to maintain context, learn from past experiences, and make informed decisions. This repository provides graph-based implementations of different memory paradigms, allowing for flexible and scalable memory management in agent systems.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains implementations of various memory models, each represented as a graph structure. These models can be used independently or combined to create more complex memory systems.

## Memory Models

The repository includes implementations for:

- **Episodic Memory**: Captures and stores specific events and experiences
- **Semantic Memory**: Manages general knowledge and facts
- **Procedural Memory**: Stores learned skills and procedures
- **Working Memory**: Handles temporary information processing
